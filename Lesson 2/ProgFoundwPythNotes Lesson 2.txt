Lesson 1: Functions

Writing a program that schedules breaks through the day. 
Keeps track of time and every 2 hours of work it opens a browser to play favorite song.
After another 2 hours, prompts another break, etc.

What are the steps?

**Init and import clock libraries**, **browser libraries**, **opening browsers capabilities**.

##Time tracker function
Track Time using Clock Import Library
init Time Since Last Song Played counter
if Time since last Song Played >= 2 hrs
Do Browser Opener Function
Do Song Player Once Browser Is Open Function
Reset Time Since last Song Played counter
Loop

##Browser Opener Function
Use **Opening Browsers Capabilities library** to open browser on computer

##Song Player Once Browser Is Open Function
Use browser libraries to navigate to youtube page containing favorite song
Each Random # of times b/w 1-10, Rickroll them instead.

working on the class stuff. Video is asking what I think the problem is when idle says 
[code python]
NameError: name 'webbrowser' is not defined
[/code]

I think it means that python doesn't know how to use webbrowser because it requires some sort of library to have been imported first that defines webbrowser.

Yup, they want us to add an import command. So our program is like this:
[code python]
import webbrowser
>>> webbrowser.open("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")
[/code]

That runs okay. Rickrolls me.

now we're adding the 'wait' function. The guy defined his program as

Repeat 3 times
wait 2 hrs
open browser

Which is simpler. We've already managed Open Browser. 
Now he googles 'python make my program wait', heads to the stackoverflow link, and it provides

[code python]
time.sleep(0.2)
[/code]

We also need to import the time module. So our current program is:
[code python]
import time
import webbrowser

time.sleep(10)
webbrowser.open("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")
[/code]

That didn't run. Troubleshot it for a while and discovered that [code python]
time.sleep(10) [/code] needs to be [code python] time.sleep(10.0) [/code] to work properly.
Next step is to add the loop. 

Think i managed it, with

[code python]
import time
import webbrowser

i = 1
if (i<3):
    time.sleep(10.0)
    webbrowser.open("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")
    i + 1
[/code]

Required some googling to work out how to handle the if statements, my first try at the [code python]
i + 1 [/code] was [code python] i++ [/code]. That didn't work.

Now I'm rickrolling myself every 10s. How grand. Used a for loop. 
[code python]
import time
import webbrowser

for x in xrange(3):
    time.sleep(10.0)
    webbrowser.open("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")
    print x
[/code]

They initialize a total breaks count at 3 and initialize a break_count at 0, then use a while loop.

[code python]
import time
import webbrowser

total_breaks = 3
break_count = 0

while(break_count < total_breaks):
    time.sleep(10.0)
    webbrowser.open("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")
    print x
    break_count = break_count + 1
[/code]
